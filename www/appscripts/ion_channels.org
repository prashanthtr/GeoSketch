// The operation of ion channels seem to be quite essential to the homeostatic
// operation of the biological cell. In essence, the model requires a cell way,
// as a lipid bilayer, and an accumulation of charges inside the cell.

// The two layers of the lipid bilayer is modeled as a self-organized one
// dimensional cellular automaton. Each cellular automaton self-configures and
// responds to perturbations. The outer layer is perturbed by the evnrionment
// and the inner layer. The inner layer is perturbed by the outer layer and the
// inside of the cell - cellular fluid. The alignment of the cells in the
// cellular automaton constitute the opening and closing of the ion-channels.

// The ion-channels ensure the passage of ions inside and outside the cell. in
// the external boundary, the ion channels provide passageway to the to the ions
// that are adjacent to the cells. Similarly, in the internal boundary, the ion
// channels provide passageway to ions that are adjacent to the internal
// boundary. The accumulation and release of ions changes the voltage/charge
// inside the cell as well as the gradient across the cell membrane.

// The charge/voltage inside the cell is represented as a number (e.g., volts).
// The cell has a resting potential which is described as a range. The cell acts
// to maintain the charge within the range specified for the resting potential.
// When the charge inside the cell is higher or lower than the range of resting
// potential, the cell opens ion channels for ion transfer. The particular
// position in which the ion-channel opens or closes is determined by the
// current gradient of the membrane potential (distributon of charges around the
// cell)


// Opening ion-channels:

// I have three of ideas for opening ion-channels: [only the first is consistent with MV vocabulary]
// 1) generating perturbations from the inside of the cell.
// 2) directly reconfiguring the internal cell boundary and using that as perturbation
// 3) directly reconfiguring the cell boundary [simplifies model with 1 membrane for bilipid membrane.]

// Vocabulary for 1:

// The cell organs generates chemicals that perturb the internal cell boundary.
// The internal boundary is also perturbed by the current state of the external
// boundary. The internal cell boundary reconfigures itself based on
// self-organized dynamics. The new state of the internal boundary acts as
// perturbations for the external boundary. The external boundary also has
// perturbations from the envroinment. Multiple perturbations at the same
// location at the same time are considered as no-change of state. Based on
// perturbations, the external boundary re-configures itself. Ion channels are
// opened at positions in which the state of the cell of the outer boundary is
// aligned with the state of the cell in the internal boundary.
// Vocabulary for 1:

// Movement: Cell moves in the direction that is opposite the concentration of
// gradient descent.
