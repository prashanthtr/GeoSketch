* Notes

// There are experiments with extending the structural coupling aspect of
// bittorio. The claim is that certain changes in cognitive structure can be
// explained through changes in dynamics of structural coupling.

//Given that bittorio has a style/class of structural patterns - i.e.,
//specification of rules through cellular automata, the question - how should
//the structure change so that the system maintains the same coupling relation
//with the environment.

// For this, structural coupling is described in three arrays - an array for the
// boundary, and an array for the environments (inside and outside the boundary)
// )other than the boundary.

// The range of permissible structures possible through perturbations are the
// 256 rules of the cellular automaton. At every step, the Ca simulates the new
// structural configurations, that maintain the correltation between the
// different sides of the boundary. A structure is stable when it persists for a
// more than a single time step.

// Stable structures result in computational of sequences such as odd and even
// sequence recognition. We will be able to describe oscillatory behahiors
// thorugh trajectories of structural changes.




// opens up a new class of hypothesis about the emergence of computing - without
// input/output representations, thorugh a combinatino of self-organization and
// coupling.

// Towards this, Varela created a model of enactive cogntiion involving a
// combinatino of self-organization and structural coupling - bittorio.

// The example of bittorio that still remains as an minmal example of enactive
// cognition addresses a different question - how does a given self-organization
// dynamics with a structural lead to rudimentary pattern recognition.

// Elsewhere, Varela has mentioned the importance of structural changes, and
// thaat iving organisms are in constant flux through their structure changes.

// One of the difficulties with extending bittorio to involve structural changes
// lies in the notion of structural coupling. In Bittorio, structures are
// tightly coupled with the environment thorugh replacement rule. The value of
// cells in bittorio's boundary (ie., cells) are replaced by the environmental
// pertrubartions. While this mode of coupling allows us to , and there are
// probably more than one rule that would bring about the same structural



// The system moves to one of the allowed structural configurations that
// maintains coupling. Multiple configurations might meet the same coupling
// goals (much like how multiple accompaniment might work/lead to sense of
// "Accompaniment" to various degrees)

// these configurations might be effected by different trajectories of
// structural changes -


// Structural changes are effected through a combination of generation and
// selection of viable structures that satisfy the constraints.


// I propose to open the dyanmics of bittorio through two steps:
// 1) Trajectories of structural change
// 2) linkages between structure and through correlation

// vastly greater class of hypothesis about hte conditions under wchih structure
// remains constant leading to an observation about the computation.


// illustrate this point as the system is an example of structural
// change

// Better fit with the other aspects of Varela's explainations changing
// structures are more characteristic of the nature of groundless that Varela
// speaks about. Structures are in constant change and have a history of
// structural coupling with the envrionment. Different structures may infact be
// coupled with different environmental states. I argue that the moments in
// which structure remains constant - are momemts when we are able to think of
// the system as structurally deterministic (in Varela's term) and are able to
// describe behavior. Connection between mechanisms / process of natural drift
// in natural selection

// Allows us to formulate hypothesis about the changes in cogntiive structure -
// Are changes in cognitive structure a result of changes in structural
// trajectories, or changes in structural coupling (e.g., weights) between
// diferent boundaries, or a combination of both.

// allows us to more explicitly study the influence of history of structural
// coupling on the changes in cogntiive structures in terms of patterns
// recognition tasks (if any are observed) - definitely people have not been
// able to study (at the high level, when are the AHA moments. At what point
// does the child have an aha moment).



* Old notes
// These are experiments with structural coupling. Varela's bittorio is one way
// to demonstrate how the reality conforms to particular mode of representation.
// However, this is described in terms of patterns of signfication that are
// brought forth through the coupling of a closed cellular autonmata in
// envirnoment of perturbations.

// In Bittorio, Varela sets out to describe the emergence of signification
// without representation and without the notion of inputs and outputs.

// Paradigmatically speaking, BIttorio stands in contrast to other kinds of
// systems - symbolic, connectionist - in two important respects: Notion of
// autonomy, and coupling with the environment.

// The notion of autonomoy is operationalized as opertional closure of the cells
// of the cellular automaton.

// The coupling with the environment is specified through domain of
// perturbations that do not destroy the operational closure.

// Elsewhere Varela has mentioned that an organism is cotinuous structural
// change.

// SO this leads to me argue that - it structure also changes along with the
// changes in the

// What this allows us to generate - is a set of hypothesis about the emergence
// of cogntiion, experience, and emergence of a world.

// One clear problem consists of extending this paradigm to demonstrate the
// viability of higher modes of cognition. However,

// It is my claim/ I'm pushing for the idea that the combination of
// 1) CA Rule
// 2) Operational closure
// 3) Coupling with envrionment

// denote a set of fundamental mechanisms/processes that may  used to explain a mode of representation
// that reality conforms to.


// Given these fundamental processes - may themselves be rich and sufficient
// enough to provide tools for demonstrating the presence of the following
// question - What are dynamic and developmental changes in the mode of
// representation, and how does reality then conform to new modes of
// representation.

// The second claim is that these dynamical developments to the modes of
// representation are structural changes that do not result in destruction of
// the systems' operational closure.


// How are structural changes selected? Since the system has no input and
// output, it is not possible to describe the system as optimizing/adapting with
// respect to an external input alone. Structural changes are selected through
// an internally specified rule or a goal. However, these structural changes may
// not be satisfice with the envrionmental constraints.

// Through the notion of natural drift. One of the structures from a set of
// viable structural changes is selected as the

// How often do structural changes occur? Do structural changes occur for every
// configurational change? Or, are there situations when structure remains
// constant, and only the configuration changes.

// How does a change in the configuration affect the structural change? Every
// change in the structure, affects the system configuration that follows.
// However, does every configuration change also affect the structure that
// produced it.

// How do structures change? which structures are selected? are there any
// relations between them?

//What is the relation between strucure and domain of perturbations?


// The domain of perturbations -
// Domain of destructive
// Structural changes through perturbartions

// The idea is that two inter-connected self-organized CA systems will guide the
// selection of the structural changes in a bittorio like system. One CA will
// produce the changes in the configuration, and the other CA will change the
// rules (structural changes) that alter the behavior of the CA. The environment
// is ordered with some rules, has a predetermined structure of its own.

// The question - whether particular modes of coupling are able to
// 1) mimic
// 2) predict
// 3) learn
// 4) break
// 5) develop (demonstrate creativity)
// 6) dynamic changes in mode of representation
// 7) structural changes the demonstrate development
// 8) growth and development in behavior
