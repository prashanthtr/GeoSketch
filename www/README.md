This is an attempt to apply the idea of Bittorio from, the book, The Embodied
Mind to a game for children based on geometric shapes.

Children select and place gemeotric shapes on a 2D dimensional grid. The
geometric shapes act as input to the arrays of Bittorio cells - that are hidden
in the background. The cells compoensates for the input perturbations.


In this first impelmentation:

1) Cells in the different layers are not connected
2) Cells in the different layers are triggered by the same rule
3) Cells in the alternate rows are colored or whatever color both players want
to choose.

Two or more players can play the game.
They can simultaneously place objects on the screen that are transmitted as
pertubrations to the other player.
The goal of the players is keep a patterns established that doesn't die down.
Then, they name the pattern that persists in time.

* The rules may then be changed to game of life like rules as well. Where
  patterns may be based on rules of adjacent cells.
